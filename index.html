        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Data are readily available but it is not valuable unless you are able to analysis and use it to solve problems. United States Fencing Association (USFA) has huge Fire Incident Case Data generated by National Fire Data Center's National Fire Incident Reporting System which consists of numerous data elements that detail fire incidents. (For example, the fire department, fire incident, the occupants, structure and equipment used, hazard material involved and casualty details.)</p>
        <p>National Fire Incident Report System (NFIRS) is a voluntary tool fire departments use to report fires and other incidents to which fire departments respond and to maintain records of in a uniform manner with the primary objectives to help State and local governments create fire reporting and analysis capabilities; and obtain data that can be used to more accurately assess and combat the fire problem at a national level. </p>
        
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>Use fire incident case data for the year 2009 to solve the following questions: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How many fire incidents in each state in 2009?</li>
          <li>How many fire incidents in each month in 2009?</li>
          <li>What are the 10 top incident types in 2009?</li>
        </ul>
